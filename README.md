# Understanding Indirect Answers Using Circa
Project for DS-GA 1012 NLU: Natural Language Understanding and Computational Semantics

### Motivation
Question-Answering models are an essential part of NLP research and provide the building blocks of many applications such as automated customer service chatbots and voice assistants. In the scope of this project, we aim to understand responses to questions without direct cue words, using the recent Circa dataset, by studying how we can use existing models and transfer learning techniques to outperform the models suggested in the "I'd rather just go to bed" paper.

### Summary of Plans
1. Recreate the results of the original paper
2. Test out different baseline models for fine-tuning
3. Experiment with different transfer learning techniques


### Project Dependencies
* python3
* pandas, numpy
* torch
* tensorflow
